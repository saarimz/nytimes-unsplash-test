# NYTIMES + UNSPLASH API TESTING

## What does this do?

This crude web app is just an exercise in using / combining multiple APIs. All this app does is create a card from the search term you input, pulling in an image from Unsplash and an article from NY Times. I've also attempted to hide my API keys.

## How can I check this out?

1. Clone the repo.
2. Get yourself an Unsplash API Key and a NYTimes API Key.
3. Create config.js in the root directory and create a config variable with `{ UNSPLASH_KEY: YOUR_UNSPLASH_API_KEY, NYT_KEY: YOUR_NYT_API_KEY }`.
4. Open up index.html in your browser.
